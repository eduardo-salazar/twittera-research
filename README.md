# Goal
Predict personality traits (Big 5 factors) using writing style from tweets

# Motivation
Currently we are surrounded by ai systems like siri, alexa which are doing a great
job on interacting with the user to some functionalities like: call someone,
schedule appointments and son on; but they like on customized interaction.

Every ai has its on way of responding and creating sentences that later are
translated into sounds using text-to-speech techniques. But the reality is that
every person has a different reaction to the writing style of the agent giving a
response. Every sentences has an emotion related and every one is more identified
with different ways of writing.

In order to create an ai that responds in a ways that the user will find likeable
we need first to identify the map personalities to understand what personalties we
like and the suggest a better sentence structure for the ai to have a more human
interaction with the user.

This project try to identify personalities of tweeter user using the writing style
as a first stage project
